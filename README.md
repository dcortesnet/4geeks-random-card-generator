# 4geeks Random Card Generator &middot; ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Create an algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:

- Every time the website refreshes, a new random card needs to show.
- The card must have one of the possible suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs, or Diamonds.
- The card value must be one of the following: 2 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to this demo: https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode-asset-images/45070ce9e774549da125bf2168da33d074e9d8baa12cdb720cfaf9f3f2c6d0c2.gif?raw=true
